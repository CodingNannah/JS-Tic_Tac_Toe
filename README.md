Game Creation Notes:

Changes:
More CSS for fun.
Robust O's to match robust X's.
Tradition: X's go first.
I take "turns" not "go's".

Challenge: 
Figuring out how to display a Cat/Draw. I tried to adapt one from the last project, researched others' same issues... no solution, yet.

Future Add: 
Play again button.
